# Average Grade Calculator (School Activity - DSA)

This is a simple C program created as part of our **DSA class activity**. The program calculates a student's grade based on their average score.

## Description

- Input: A student's average score (integer).  
- Output: The corresponding grade:
  - Grade A: for 90–100
  - Grade B: for 80–89
  - Grade C: for 70–79
  - Grade D: for 60–69
  - Grade F: for below 60

The program uses conditional statements (if-else) to determine the grade.
